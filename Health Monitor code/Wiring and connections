These are the parts I used:

Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi
MAX30102 Pulse-Oximeter Module
MLX90614 Contactless Temperature Sensor Module
Some jumper cables during testing (I later soldered everything onto a vero board when i was done)

Connections:

Both the MAX30102 and MLX90614 use I2C communication, which allows multiple sensors to share the same SCL (clock) and SDA (data) lines.
Connect the VCC pins of both sensors to the 3.3V output on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.
Connect the GND pins of both sensors to any GND pin on the Arduino.
Connect both sensors' SCL pins to the A5/SCL pin on the Arduino.
Connect both sensors' SDA pins to the A4/SDA pin on the Arduino.
